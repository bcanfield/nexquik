  ```
  - This command will  watch for file changes under the `src` and `templateApp` directories and spin up a local next.js project that is using the output from Nexquik.
  - Check out the `dev` folder for the details of the local next.js project
- To run tests, run:
  ```
  npm run test
  ```

  - Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
