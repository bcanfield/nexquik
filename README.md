**Nexquik** is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of setting up a complete Next.js app directory with server components, all based on a Prisma schema. 

This empowers developers to rapidly scaffold their applications, focusing more on building features and less on repetitive setup tasks.


Documentation coming soon.
